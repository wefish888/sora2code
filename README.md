Sora2Code.com - Your Ultimate Sora Invite Code Aggregation Platform

  Sora2Code.com is a specialized invite code aggregation platform designed specifically for OpenAI Sora users. We
  intelligently collect and organize Sora invite codes from social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter/X,
  helping users quickly discover and access the latest invite code resources. Our mission is to make Sora more
  accessible to everyone who wants to experience OpenAI's revolutionary video generation technology.

  At the heart of our platform is an intelligent code collection system powered by Claude AI technology. Our
  automated system scans Reddit, Twitter, and other social platforms every 10 minutes, extracting and validating
  invite codes in real-time. The system employs smart validation to ensure code authenticity, recognizing the
  standard 6-character alphanumeric format while filtering out common false positives like English words such as
  "THANKS" or "PLEASE". This intelligent approach ensures that users only see genuine, usable Sora invite codes.

  The platform offers a comprehensive set of features for code discovery and management. Users can browse codes
  sorted by multiple dimensions including time, copy count, and community votes. Each code displays its current
  status, whether active or expired, along with its original source platform. We've implemented a community-driven
  voting system that supports both anonymous and registered users, allowing the community to collectively identify
  the most reliable codes. Additionally, users can favorite their preferred codes, track copy counts, and report
  problematic entries to maintain platform quality.

  Our technical architecture represents a modern, scalable approach to web application development. The backend
  utilizes Node.js with Express framework and supports dual deployment modes including traditional server deployment
   and Cloudflare Workers edge computing. We use Prisma ORM with SQLite for efficient data management, complemented
  by Redis for caching and rate limiting. The frontend is built with Astro v4 featuring hybrid rendering
  capabilities, React 18 for interactive components, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. This architecture can
  be deployed either as a traditional full-stack application or entirely on Cloudflare's infrastructure for
  cost-effective, globally distributed performance.

  Security is a cornerstone of our platform design. All API requests and responses are protected through end-to-end
  RSA and AES-GCM encryption. The encryption flow involves client-generated AES keys, RSA public key exchange, and
  AES-GCM encrypted response data, ensuring that user data remains secure throughout transmission. We also implement
   JWT authentication for user sessions, Redis-backed rate limiting to prevent abuse, and comprehensive audit
  logging systems to maintain platform integrity and security.

  What sets Sora2Code.com apart is our commitment to automation and user experience. Unlike manual code sharing
  sites, our AI-powered system works around the clock to discover new codes as soon as they're shared online. Users
  don't need to manually search through countless social media posts or join multiple communities. Everything is
  aggregated in one convenient location with a clean, intuitive interface that works seamlessly across desktop and
  mobile devices. The platform is completely free to use, with core browsing features available without
  registration, while advanced features like favorites and voting are available to registered users.

  AI-generated video content for their channels. Technology enthusiasts can be among the first to experience
  OpenAI's latest video generation capabilities. Social media users can discover the newest invite codes shared by
